<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is an extension to the previous project
[here](https://github.com/nrupatunga/pytorch-deaf) on edge aware
filters.

The link to paper is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00643)

### Description

This paper shows effectiveness of the following in implementing image
processing filters

- Fully Convolutional architecture with dilated filters, that leads to
better receptive field for image filters and very smaller models
- Neat trick on Identity weight initialization
- Simple Mean Square Error loss

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

#### Code Setup
```
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/nrupatunga/Fast-Image-Filters.git

# install all the required repositories
$ cd Fast-Image-Filters
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add current directory to environment
$ cd src
$ source settings.sh
```

#### Data Download and Preparation

Since the author has not released the dataset and dataset preparation
script, I couldn't share the same here. Please mail cqf@ust.hk for the
scripts and data. Feel free to message me for any help you need.

#### Training
```
$ cd Fast-Image-Filters/src/run/

# Modify the data_dir variable in train.py

# run to train
$ python train.py
```

#### Testing
```
$ cd Fast-Image-Filters/src/run

# Change the model paths in app.py

$ python app.py
```
